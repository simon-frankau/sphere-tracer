# sphere-tracer - A simple ray-tracer

Way back in, er, apparently 1999, I wrote a very simple ray-tracer. It
traces spheres. Nothing but spheres. Shiny spheres.

If you've seen my excel-ray-tracer repository, you may have guessed
that I like ray-tracers. They're simple to write yet can produce
remarkably pretty results. They allow all kinds of extensions, from
highly-optimised code through support for complicated geometric
primitive, or fantastic textured, or whatever.

This tracer has none of that. On the other hand, it's simple and
straightforward, and (looking back) easy-to-read.

## Instructions

Compile it with build.sh. Run the produced executable "tracer". You
will need to have libpng installed. A PNG file should appear in the
current directory. You can alter the image produced by modifying the
source file, recompiling and rerunning. How high tech!
